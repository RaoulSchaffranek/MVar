description: MVar data type for predictable low-level concurrency
features:
- title: Focused
  details: No dependencies. Barely 1.12KB minified and gzipped. MVar is only concerned with flow control and integrates with any state-management solution.
- title: Univeral
  details: Runs on every JavaScript-runtime-system. Builds are available for ES6 native modules, UMD, AMD, CommonJS, and a standalone script.
- title: Hygienic
  details: We use a combination of static type checking, property-based testing, and static code analysis to prevent bugs from sneaking into the system.
