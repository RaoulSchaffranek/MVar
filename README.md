MVar is a low-level library for concurrent programming in TypeScript and JavaScript. It provides a single data type of the same name, inspired by [Haskell's MVar](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Control-Concurrent-MVar.html#t:MVar). An `MVar` represents an abstract resource that can be shared by multiple concurrent tasks. Access-operations on MVars are atomic and serve as synchronization primitives between concurrent tasks.
